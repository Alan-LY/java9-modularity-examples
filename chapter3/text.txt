The fiasco of the Gallipoli campaign was caused, in part, by a global food crisis.
The Ottoman empire’s entry into the first world war, on Germany’s side, blocked grain exports from the Russian empire, which then encompassed Ukraine.
By forcing the passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, Britain and its allies hoped to knock the Turks out of the war and restore Russian trade.
That would help lower soaring food prices, and strengthen Russia’s weak finances. But the landings in the Dardanelles in 1915 turned to disaster and Allied forces withdrew after a year.

A century on, the West faces a similar conundrum: how to get Ukraine’s vast food crop past Russia’s blockade to relieve global food shortages? Andrei Stavnitser, the owner of Ukraine’s largest private shipping-terminal operator, TransInvestService, says that Ukrainian grain silos are largely full, and there is not enough room for this year’s crop. “If we can’t store it, it will start rotting,” he says. Frustratingly, Russia is able to export its grain from the Black Sea while Ukraine’s crop is shut in. “Unblocking Odessa is as important as providing weapons to Ukraine,” he says.
